# Melanoma Detection

Melanoma Detection : Detecting Skin cancer with CNN Models

## Problem Statement :
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## Description:
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Dataset used: 
SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification dataset 


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy and pandas
- Tensorflow
- Keras
